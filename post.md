Synopsis
> So you're interested in blogging? `{<3}` **Thank you** for 
considering AirPair a home to share your creativity and knowledge. The 
top 20% of posts on airpair.com<sup>[AirPair Posts](https://www.airpair.com/posts) Section (at airpair.com/posts)</sup>
get viewed on average more than 150,000 times within 12 months! Publishing
top content rarely comes with instant gratification. 40% of
posts submitted to the `community review` process do not make it
through to published. This guide includes background, guidelines 
and tips to best leverage community help to improve your post's ratings
and ultimately attract more readers. Developers of all levels are welcome to
contribute beginner through advanced content. **Read this guide in full BEFORE submitting posts to the community.**

## 1 Community values

AirPair's mission is to share software knowledge. In our verbiage, being 
an *"expert"* does not necessarily involve mastering cutting-edge knowledge. 
An *AirPair Expert* is someone who has attained enough proficiency in both 
*technical knowledge* and *expression* to effectively communicate and teach 
a concept of any difficulty from beginner through advanced.

Advantages of publishing on AirPair include *(1)* positioning yourself as an 
Expert available to consult on the knowledge you present and *(2)* connecting
with other experts in your domain that want to share similar passions by 
helping refine and evolve your posts.

Publishing on AirPair is as much about learning through helping as learning 
through help. When deciding to publish here, you should be interested in more 
than your own posts and either *(a)* be wanting to help others over (paid) live 
pair programming sessions or *(b)* already reviewing posts by others.

## 2 Platform evolution in progress

** Features updates & bugfixes: **

AirPair's Post Section<sup>1</sup> is one of fastest growing and most 
trafficked software blogs ever. That said, we recognize our tooling as 
half complete and due for more polish. Most folks perceive AirPair 
as big company. It's actually run with lots of love `{<3}` by one person.
The authoring features get a wave of attention every 3-6 months.

** Community etiquette: **

We'd like you to be aware of and acknowledge the contributions of 10
distinguished **"Resident Authors"**, awarded the `{R}` badge for helping 
others and embodying the culture we want to grow. Please pay special attention 
to their feedback and opinions.

Reviews from other community members will come in many different flavors.
We're aiming to steer clear of short praise like *"Awesome post"* and utilize
the review system to facilitate intelligent discussion that leads to better
content and collaboration. Some folks have sweeter delivery than others 
and though your post may be excellent, and rated high by a reviewer, their 
initial feedback may mostly contain critique so as to avoid repeating things 
said and focus on what could be improved. Reviews are a powerful mechanism to
consider things with fresh perspective. Take ALL feedback seriously, even if
ultimately you completely disagree and choose to disregard everything someone
says, the process will benefit you and your readers. We ask you adopt a thick
skin and **thank all reviewers for taking time to read and comment even if you
don't like what was said**. 

Trolling and arguments are generally discouraged. There are no definitions or
processes yet for inappropriate behavior. It's a good example of an area for
the community to decide as we continue moving forward.

** Tip ** if you've incorporated feedback from a review, reply to let the
reviewer know. They are able to update both their rating and comment at any 
time and will likely increase the stars given and replace previous critique with
praise.

## 3 Submission guidelines

*Last updated Aug 8, 2015*

When you feel your post is beginning to look good enough for others, it's time 
to familiarize and incorporate the guidelines of this section. It's rare for
folks to deeply review posts more than once. To get the most creative input, 
avoid reviewers having to point out things already covered here.

### 3.1 Content format & topics

#### 3.1.1 Long form

<!-- Many different written formats conduct software knowledge successfully. One
 reason StackOverflow became successful was discipline and consistency around
 the Q/A format and types of questions accepted by the community.-->

The AirPair Posts Section is focused on long form technical blog posts ideally
ranging from 1500-4000 words (including code blocks), though some of our
all-time high trafficking posts were as long as 10,000-15,000 words.

#### 3.1.2 Post types

Posts usually fall into one of these `types`:

- **Tutorial** or step by step guide (beginner, intermediate or advanced)
- **Comparison** like "SQL vs NoSQL" or "AngularJS vs BackboneJS"
- **Show and tell** of a neat thing you built and open-sourced
- **Deep dive** on a specific language or framework internals or feature
- **Knowledge list** like "Top 10 mistakes ..." or "5 tips for ..."
- **Opinion piece** on *anything software* from academia to community activity
or reviews of new technologies and software services.

#### 3.1.3 Settling on a topic

Posts must be about software! Content covering programming and non-programming 
software-related disciplines including but not limited to UX, Design, Marketing 
and running Software Business are accepted.

We value creativity and originality most and thus encourage you **let your passions primarily guide topic choice** as we feel this is where the magic
happens most.

Both *(i)* aiming to appeal to the masses and *(ii)* focusing on something 
niche to strike very deep with a few are good approaches. Just make sure enough 
you can find at least 3 reviewers who understand and care about your topic to
pass community review and get published. 

#### 3.1.4 Choosing a title

The title is the most important part of a post. Every character is 100x more 
imporant that one in the actual post and can be the difference between being
at the top of search engine resuls or never being discovered at all.

For reasons spanning UX, engagement / comprehension, SEO, Social Sharing and 
GitHub constraints, **post titles *(h1 element)* should be less than 50 chars**.

Mention at least the main technology if not multiple technologies you are
exploring as it is officially referred to (e.g. `AngularJS` is better than 
`Angular`, but `Meteor` is better than `MeteorJS`). You are encouraged to mix
it up with as many variations you can use in your post and headings / sub-headings 
to cover more combinations.

<!--1.  **Specific** - you should mention not only the technology you're working with (Angular, React, etc), but also the particular sub-topic.-->

Each word and the order of words can have dramatic implications. Consider:

*Title 1* 
> "Tic Tac Toe! Scope in Directives: Transclusion Scope, Template Scope for Angular"

*Title 2*
> "Transclusion and Template Scope in AngularJS Directives Demystified

**Tip 1** Avoid wasting words that are not relevant to the software aspects
you are exploring that would never be used to lead a user searching for what
your content covers. `Tick Tac Toe!` will send someone to a games website and
is essentially a waste of characters that could have been used to be found by
another phrase.
- - -
**Tip 2** Google sees combinations of sub-phrases by removing / including 
words. The same words in different orders are NOT equal. It's best to aim
more common and official ways words are ordered (e.g. in framework docs/guides). 
So "AngularJS Directives" is more powerful than "Directives AngularJS".
- *Title 1* yields key-phrases:
  - By obvious sub-strings:
    - "Transclusion Scope"
    - "Template Scope for Angular" 
  - By removal of words:
    - "Scope Directives" 
    - "Directive Angular"
  - By repetition:
    - 3 x "Scope Angular"
    - 2 x "Scope Template"
    - 1 x "Scope Directives"
    - 2 x "Directive Scope"
- *Title 2* yields key-phrases:
  - By obvious sub-strings:
    - "Template Scope in Angular" 
    - "Scope in AngularJS"     
    - "Scope in AngularJS Directives" 
    - "AngularJS Directives" 
  - By removal of words:
    - "Transclusion Scope in AngularJS" 
    - "Template Scope in AngularJS" 
    - "Transclusion in AngularJS Directives"
    - 1 x "Transclusion Scope"
    - 1 x "Template Scope"
  - No repetition
- - -
**Tip 3** Try to incorporate eye-catching words that evoke the value proposition 
of the post.

<!-- TODO, give examples of eye-catching words-->


### 3.2 Original content

AirPair's Posts section is for original content only. (1) Do not submit content
already published elsewhere. (2) Even if published first on AirPair, do not
republish your post anywhere - including your personal site. Not leaving content 
and associated acknowledgement of community contributions exclusively on 
airpair.com may lead to your post being taken down and possibly being banned from
publishing again.

Under all circumstances, copyright content will be immediately removed. 
Google and review existing posts that are similarly titled posts before getting 
started. Posts may be removed even if they look similar to ones published 
prior on other sites.

### 3.3 Self promotion

Both personal and company self promotion is encouraged within these 
guidelines:

- **Associate a professional avatar 
<sup>Manage AirPair avatars via [gravatar.com](http://en.gravatar.com/)</sup> with  your AirPair account.** 
- Connect at least two social profiles for credibility.

<!-- Guidelines for bio text and to go here-->
<!-- Guidelines for and company promotion to go here-->

### 3.4 Formatting 

Posts should appear professionally formatted. You can tell by the length of 
this guide, we pay a lot of attention to detail, including visual aspects. 
Sticking to pure markdown and avoiding hybrid html and inline css where 
possible is the easiest way to keep things clean. 

**Tip 1** Author in the AirPair Editor from the get go. Live rendering will help you think about formatting and see things as you write.
- - -
**Tip 2** The AirPair Editor rendering panel is debounced according to 
how long your post is. At the start it refreshes almost instantly and updates less frequently as you go to stop your browser from hanging. To make the rendering panel refresh at
will focus on the panel by clicking on it.
- - -
**Tip 3** Become a markdown master
<sup>Master Markdown in an hour with the [Darling Fireball Guide](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)</sup> and explore 
elements like images, ordered / unordered lists, code blocks, blockquotes,
**bold** / *italic* font, horizontal rules and line breaks to create 'white
space'. Long blocks of text can be visually hard to digestible and cause 
readers to give up and bounce.

### 3.5 Language

Refrain from using coarse language and questionable socio-cultural statements,
including sexist and racist remarks.

Check spelling and grammar. As a guide there should be no more than
10 obvious mistakes per 1000 words.

** Tip ** Use a spell checker and if necesssary get a friend to review your
English before you submit.

### 3.6 Post structure

Unless you go viral, **90% of readers will arrive at your post via a search engine**. Both the platform and structure outlined here, have evolved to 
optimize SEO and retaining short attention spans. 

#### 3.6.1 Synopsis

At the top of your post **include a 1 paragraph summary** nested inside a 
blockquote (`>`) introducing the top-level idea, content format and who the 
post is relevant for (i.e. level of developer / prerequisite knowledge). 
Readers should know in 30 seconds if a post is what they are seeking 
and relevant to their experience.

The synopsis falls out of the Table of Contents (ToC) and the word *Synopsis* 
is considered a *pseudo heading* i.e. only a heading in the visual sense.
Here is some example markdown for a synopsis:
````markdown
Synopsis
> So you're interested in blogging? **Thank you** for 
considering AirPair a home to share your creativity and knowledge `{<3}`. The 
top 20% of posts at airpair.com/posts 
get viewed on average more than 150,000 times within 12 months!
````

#### 3.6.2 Links

airpair.com gets crawled many times per day. **Properly prefix links with `http(s)://`** to avoid driving jk crazy with 404 notifications.

As a general rule, the more links in your post, particularly up at the top, the 
sooner readers will click off and not come back. Use links judiciously to
increase engagement.

**Tip 1** Double check all links by clicking them from the full preview view.
- - -
**Tip 2** The more links included in your post, particularly towards the top, 
the sooner most readers will click off your posts and not come back. Utilize 
&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; tags to reduce link surface and move the exit paths
down to the auto-generated *References* section at the bottom of your post.

#### 3.6.3 ToC, headings and subheadings

The Table of Contents (ToC) widget automatically grabs headings 
( **\#\#** / **\#\#\#** / **\#\#\#\#** ) out of your markdown and renders them 
down the right hand side of your post as table of links enabling the user to 
immediately seek to any given section. 

Headings are extremely important and one of the drivers of AirPair's search 
traffic success so pay attention!

** 3.6.3.1 *One (`h1`) heading to rule them all!* **  
h1s (**#**) should NOT appear in your post markdown. Correct HTML includes a
single h1 element in any document. More than one h1 will
negatively impact your post's SEO.

**3.6.3.2 *Optimize for search and seek* **  
Your post will probably be on one of many tabs a reader seeks through as they 
Google for instant gratification. Top posts provide both holistic
value and compartmentalized value in each section when considered in isolation. 

Readers often search for VERY specific things and one section in your post 
may be exactly what they need, but the rest irrelevant. Well chosen headings 
help readers find your post using search engines and quickly seek to the 
relevant content before giving up when unsure if the effort to scan your post
is worth it.

**Tip 1** Avoid headings like "Introduction", "Conclusion", "Step 1", "Getting 
Started" that will inhibit the content in those sections being found.
- - -
**Tip 2** Think about what readers would type to find each section
in isolation. This will dramatically help the consistency and overall structure 
of your post and identify when it may be better to split out multiple
concepts under their own headings.

** 3.6.3.3 *ToC and heading lengths* **  
A ToC should be short enough that it's container element does not render in
css auto-scroll mode. To keep your ToC a reasonable height, don't have more than 
one or two long headings spaning multiple lines in the ToC widget. 

**Tip 1** Use psuedo headings (Like in this section) instead of h5 and h6.
- - -
**Tip 2** Consider breaking a post into multiple parts if you can't figure
out how to keep the ToC a reasonable length.


** 3.6.3.4 *Numbering format* **  
Numbering is optional. In some (usually longer) posts they can add value. In 
others it can detract with unnecessary visual clutter and diluted SEO. 
If you choose to number sections in your post, copy the format in this post.

** 3.6.3.4 Gotcha's**  
1. Try to avoid headings (especially h1) in code-samples when possible.

### 3.7 Code samples

Triple check all code runs before submitting your post. Readers are often
already overwhelmed and frustrated learning the subject matter. Commonly they 
ignore how great your post is and leave negative comments if they 
lose time when code doesn't run unsure if it's your code sample or them doing
something wrong.  

**Supported language <sup>Languages supported by the [Prism syntax highlighting plugin](http://prismjs.com/#languages-list)</sup> code samples MUST be correctly syntax highlighted**. ***Tip 1*** If it's not highlighting in the 
AirPair Editor, it won't highlight when published. *** Tip 2 *** A common 
confusion is the use of `markup` as the key to highlight html. `markup`
can also be used for xml - hence the name ;).

<pre>&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;markup
&lt;example title="markdown for markup syntax highlighting"&gt;
Nice colors!
&lt;/example&gt;
&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;</pre>

```markup
<example title="markdown for markup syntax highlighting">
Nice colors!
</example>
```

### 3.8 Media

#### 3.8.1 Use https
Prefixed ALL image urls with `https` and NOT `http` or readers will get 
insecure warnings from their browser.

#### 3.8.2 Tile image
The relevance, clarity and professionalism of the main tile image used to 
represent a post is VERY important. The tile image gets used not only in
the header of a post, but in the "tiles" list view of the Posts section,
tagged collections of posts, (eventually) on your AirPair profile,
in sharing to Facebook & LinkedIn via the `ogImage` tag, tweets by @airpair
and (soon) in weekly content digest emails.

Potential readers will prematurely judge your post similar to the way people 
"judge a book by its cover". Follow the following guidelines:

1. Make your tile relevant. Random images & artwork are discouraged.
2. Use a solid color or pattern as the images background.
3. Incorporate one logo or even multiple logos of the technologies
being explored in your content.
4. Optionally incorporate the AirPair logo <sup>AirPair logo uploaded and accessible by `https` via an [issue of this post's repo](https://github.com/airpair/authoring-guide/issues/1)</sup>
5. Host your image somewhere that supports https. imgur, github.io or even
the issues section of the repo created for your post as good options.
6. Tile size and dimensions should be large enough for social
sharing, but not too big to take unnecessarily bandwidth and time to load.
Facebook App Tiles (810x450) make a happy medium. 
7. Minimum of 640px in width is required to flush in line with the width of 
the post's body.

** Tip 1 ** Use a tool like Canva<sup>[canva.com](https://www.canva.com) is a web based graphics tool for creating share friendly images</sup>, 
it's a fast way to create images in a browser. You can even start from their 
"Facebook App" template to get the right dimensions. 
- - -
** Tip 2 ** Should you need high-quality free images try
FreeImages.com<sup>[freeimages.com](http://www.freeimages.com/) is a good first stop for royalty free stock images</sup>.
- - -
** Tip 3 ** Often the bottoms of tile images get cut off when shown in the 
list view so place more importance on the top parts vs bottom parts of your
image.

## 4 Publishing

### 4.1 When to publish

You can self publish with 3 or more reviews with an average of 4/5 
stars or more. 

**Tip** Once you feel ready to push it live, we recommend to step away
for 2 days leaving your post in review, before coming back for one final
start to end read. You'll almost always spot one or two things you wish to
improve before pulling the trigger.

### 4.2 Getting reviews

### 4.2.1 Who should review

People reviewing your post should have sufficient technical knowledge to
comprehend the accuracy of your post and formulate genuine feedback and insight.

If your topic is broad, enough community members will likely review without
any action. If you don't get enough reviews you can tweet to the public to look
at your post. If your topic is niche, you may need to perform outreach and ask
subject matter experts outside the AirPair community to review your post.

Do not ask friends to review unless they are also an expert on your topic. 
Ratings are how the community acknowledges exceptional work. We will remove 
posts and ban authors that try to game ratings in any way.

** Tip ** Researching and emailing others blogging on similar topics is a very
powerful way of networking and very beneficial to growing our community.

## 6 W.I.P. Idiosyncrasies

*Section last updated 08 Aug, 2015*

Most things in this section are a result of the work in progress nature of
the platform and will disappear over time. They are quite important to be 
aware of.

** 6.1 Merge quickly**  
Acknowledging contributions is an important community etiquette. Eventually all
contributions and updated dates will be displayed on each post. 

The AirPair Editor is not yet capable of handling more than basic forking 
scenarios. Things like merge conflicts will make the effort of accepting and
acknowledging contributions too high. 

**Tip** The easiest approach is to merge a contribution even if it's only 90% 
there and add the last 10% of polish yourself on top of their commit.

** 6.2 Manually add new lines**  
At one point we tried to get the editor to auto generate new lines after 80 
characters, but things went wrong and we'll try again. A good practice is to
manually add new lines just before the gray line on the right edge of the 
editor. Without new lines, edits made by contributors will be difficult to 
see as git may track a whole paragraph instead of an 80 char chunk for simple
spelling corrections.

** 6.3 Syntax highlighting not working**  
Email team at AirPair, as it could be recently added or intentionally not yet included in our custom build because we didn't want users downloading 100's of Kbs of unused language packs.
